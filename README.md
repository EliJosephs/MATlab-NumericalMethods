# MATlab-NumericalMethods
Numerical Method functions, such as root finding, integration, and derivation. 

All functions are original and written by Eli Josephs. MATlab has built-in functions that are better optimized, however, these functions serve as a proof of concept, and are great practice for developing algorithms that will always work. The details of every function are given at the beginning of every .m file, which will also return in the MATlab command window when given the command:

help <function name>
  
Each function also contains comments, for better understanding.
