## Simpson's 1/3 Rule Integration


Simpson applies the Simpson's 1/3 Rule to integrate y over x. 

Inputs:

x:     x must be an equally spaced array, covering the interval of integration

y:     y must be an array containing function values corresponding to x



Outputs:

I:     Resulting estimate of the integral



**Notes and Warnings:**

 Simpson evaluates the integral using Simpson's 1/3 Rule for intervals of
 x which contain an even number of bins. That is, the number of elements
 in x is odd. 

 If the number of bins is odd (number of elements in x is even), then the
 last bin will be calculated using a single iteration of the trapezoidal
 rule. This will increase the resulting error. A warning will be displayed
 in the command console. 

 The x vector is checked for linearity to 13 decimal points, so Simpson
 may erroneously accept a non-linearly spaced x vector, if the difference 
 between consecutive distances between elements differs by less than 
 0.0000000000001. This accounts for subtractive cancellation errors, and
 spacing generated by linspace() which may be accurate to 14 decimal
 places, with the 15th place holding error. This truncation in linearity
 checking may affect the result of Simpson, with larger errors occurring
 for larger resulting integrals. It is recommended to generate x using
 linspace(), or ensure that tabulated data is spaced correctly.
