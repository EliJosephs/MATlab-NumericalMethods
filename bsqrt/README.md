## Bakhshali Method Square Root

bsqrt calculates the square root of x using the Bakhshali Method.
   The Bakhshali Method converges quartically, meaning high precision
   results can be found quickly.

   Inputs:
   x  - Radicand
   Ea - Optional. Approximate relative error, in percent. Default (with no
        input) is 0.000001%

   Outputs:
   y  - Result
   it - Number of iterations of the Bakhshali Method performed
